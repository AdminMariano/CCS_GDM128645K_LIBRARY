![GLCD](images/gdm12864k-1.png) ![GLCD](images/gdm12864k-2.png)


A lightweight and educational graphics library for the GDM12864-5K graphical LCD, powered by the ST7920 controller. Designed for bare-metal programming on the PIC18F25K22 using CCS C, with full support for Proteus simulation.

---

## Features

- Pixel-level control (set, clear, toggle)
- Text rendering (custom font support)
- Graphics primitives: lines, rectangles, circles
- Full-screen buffer management
- Direct register manipulation (no abstraction layers)
- Compatible with Proteus for simulation and validation

## About the Controller: ST7920

The ST7920 is a versatile controller for 128x64 GLCDs. It supports both serial and parallel interfaces, and is widely used in embedded systems. This library uses the **serial mode** for reduced pin usage and faster updates.

### Key ST7920 Features:
- 128x64 pixel resolution
- Built-in CGROM for ASCII characters
- Supports custom graphics via RAM access
- SPI-like serial interface (3-wire)

## Proteus Simulation
![GLCD](images/simulation.png)

This project includes a ready-to-use Proteus `.DSN` file for testing the GLCD interface with the PIC18F25K22. It demonstrates:

- Initialization sequence
- Pixel plotting
- Text rendering
- Real-time updates
